Tsunamis are giant waves caused by earthquakes or volcanic eruptions under the sea. Out in the depths of the ocean, tsunami waves do not
 dramatically increase in height. But as the waves travel inland, they build up to higher and higher heights as the depth of the ocean decreases.
Coastal flooding is the main impact of a tsunami.
They are also able to erode the foundations of coastal structures.
Tsunamis give no natural warnings except when the wave is approaching the sea retreats exposing hundreds of metres of seabed and beach.
The waves then hit the land at intervals of between 5 and 40 minutes. The tsunami doesnâ€™t break like normal waves it keeps travelling on over
the land for as far as it can, this can be as much as 1km inland.
